			The name itself conjures up an image of a land of imposing ice formations, and while that isn’t too far off, Iceland is more than just arctic temps and shining glaciers. Don’t let the cold deter you: Iceland might be almost at the top of the world, just below the Arctic Circle, but its winter temperatures are often warmer than those in New York (and it's only a 5-hour plane ride from New York, too).<br>

			While its dramatic, otherworldly natural wonders, especially the northern lights, are nothing short of magical, there are many more reasons you’ll be enchanted on a visit to Iceland.<br>
			So pack your (faux) fur-trimmed hat and prepare to be wowed by this unique little island country.

			Hidden at the bottom of the world, New Zealand is the closest populated country to the South Pole. With that, the country is one of the most surprising of the world. What makes New Zealand so popular with backpackers is the thousands of activities in an uncrowned natural environment. In other words, it's the experience of a lifetime!<br>

			"There are few countries on this planet as diverse, unspoiled and utterly, utterly photogenic," says the Lonely Planet. But more than the natural jewel that is New Zealand, you will be amazed by the kindness of its people. Open a map in the street and locals will stop to show you the way.<br>

			Most of New Zealand's uniqueness comes from its natural wonders and culture.<br>
